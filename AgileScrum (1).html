	Agile SW Development

 <i>plus</i> Scrum in-depth</h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Plan-driven and agile development</h1>
<ul>
<li>Plan-driven (predictive) development</li>
<ul>
<li>A plan-driven approach to software engineering is based around separate development stages with the outputs to be produced at each of these stages planned in advance.</li>
<li>Not necessarily waterfall model – plan-driven, incremental development is possible</li>
<li>Iteration occurs within activities. </li>
</ul>
<li>Agile development</li>
<ul>
<li>Specification, design, implementation and testing are inter-leaved and the outputs from the development process are decided through a process of negotiation during the software development process.</li>
<li>A cadence of multiple deliverables is better able to help a project keep progress and provide better estimates rather than having everything be &quot;80% done&quot;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Scrum Theory:
Process Control Models</h1>
<h2><b>PREDICTIVE</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Work and outcomes are understood before execution.
</li>
<li>Given a well-defined set of inputs, the same outputs are generated every time.
</li>
<li>Follow the pre-determined steps to get known results.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>EMPIRICAL</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Frequent inspection and adaptation occurs as work proceeds.
</li>
<li>Processes are accepted as imperfectly designed.

</li>
<li>Outputs are often unpredictable and unrepeatable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Customer knows what he wants.
Engineers know how to build it.
Nothing changes along the way.</p>
<p>Customer discovers what he wants.
Engineers discover how to build it.
Things change along the way.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Why the break from Waterfall?</h1>
<h2>On February 2001, 17 software developers met at the&nbsp;Snowbird&nbsp;resort in&nbsp;Utah&nbsp;to discuss lightweight development methods.</h2>
<h2>They published the&nbsp;<i>Manifesto for Agile Software Development</i></h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</h1>
<ul>
<li>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. </li>
<li>Through this work we have come to value:</li>
<ul>
<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
</ul>
<li>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, 
we value the items on the left more.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Twelve Principles of 
the Agile Manifesto</h1>
<ul>
<li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
<li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
<li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
<li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
<li>Build projects around motivated individuals.  Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
<li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development.  The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>
<li>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential.</li>
<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Agile Programming</h1>
<p>The aim of agile methods is to reduce overheads in the software process (e.g. by limiting documentation) and to be able to respond quickly to changing requirements without excessive rework.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Scrum
The most prevalent of the Agile Methodologies</h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Definition of scrum</h1>
<ul>
<li>Scrum (n): A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. </li>
<li>Scrum is: </li>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight </li>
<li>Simple to understand </li>
<li>Difficult to master </li>
</ul>
<li>Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage complex product development since the early 1990s. </li>
<li>Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products; rather, it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated <b>roles</b>, <b>events</b>, <b>artifacts</b>, and <b>rules</b>. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum’s success and usage. </li>
<li>The rules of Scrum bind together the events, roles, and artifacts, governing the relationships and interaction between them. The rules of Scrum are described throughout this document. </li>
<li>Specific tactics for using the Scrum framework vary and are described elsewhere. </li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Scrum in a picture</h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">The Three Legs of Empiricism
</h1>
<ul>
<li>Transparency
Transparency allows all facets of any Scrum process to be observed by anyone. This promotes an easy and transparent flow of information throughout the organization and creates an open work culture. In Scrum, transparency is depicted through:</li>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Artifacts</li>
<li>Project Vision Statement</li>
<li>Prioritized Product Backlog</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Meetings</li>
<li>Sprint Review Meetings</li>
<li>Release Planning Schedule</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Burndown Chart</li>
<li>Scrumboard</li>
<li>Inspection</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and<i> </i>making decisions based on what is known</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspection
Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances. </li>
<ul>
<li>Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at the point of work. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Adaptation</li>
<p>Adaptation happens as the Scrum Team and Stakeholders learn through transparency and inspection and then adapt by making improvements in the work they are doing., especially through Sprint Retrospectives and constant risk identification.</p>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Scrum in a nutshell</h1>
<ul>
<li>A Team commits to delivering working software in 30 days or less.</li>
<li>A time is scheduled to show that software</li>
<li>The Team creates the software</li>
<li>The Team offers their work for inspection and adapts the plan for the next cycle</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">More on the Development Team</h1>
<ul>
<li>The team composition is constant throughout a Sprint</li>
<li>Typically has 3-9 members, with the sweet spot around 6</li>
<li>May have partially allocated members</li>
<ul>
<li>Although this is often considered an impediment as they have other priorities</li>
<li>For instance, Database Administrators, User Interface Design experts, Technical Writers</li>
</ul>
<li>Non-sequential execution is key</li>
<li>Everyone pitches in regardless of individual skill specialty</li>
<li>The Development Team is held to account as a unit.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Teamwork in Scrum</h1>
<ul>
<li>The ‘Scrum master’ is a facilitator who arranges daily meetings, tracks the backlog of work to be done, records decisions, measures progress against the backlog and communicates with customers and management outside of the team.</li>
<li>The whole team attends short daily meetings (Scrums) where all team members share information, describe their progress since the last meeting, problems that have arisen and what is planned for the following day. </li>
<ul>
<li>This means that everyone on the team knows what is going on and, if problems arise, can re-plan short-term work to cope with them. </li>

(DoD)</h1>
<ul>
<li>An increment is deemed complete 
after all PBIs for the corresponding Sprint meet their done 
criteria and their acceptance criteria.  
</li>
<li>In pure Scrum, <i><b>the team </b></i>defines the definition of done.  However, those performing the work and those accepting the work product must share a common definition of “Done”. </li>
</ul>
<h2><b>     The DoD is NOT the same as Acceptance Criteria</b></h2>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The Definition of Done is a clear and concise list of requirements that the user story must satisfy for the team to call it complete. </li>
<li>The DoD is a list of technical and non-technical requirements for each user story to meet for the project.  It must apply to <u>all</u> items in the backlog. </li>
<li>DoD is a contract between the Scrum Team &amp; the Product Owner. </li>
<li>User story Acceptance Criteria can be modified over the course of the Sprint as the user story is further refined. </li>
<li>The DoD is set during the Release Planning or Sprint 0 – not generally modified once active development sprint cycles are underway. </li>
<li>The DoD is often confused with acceptance criteria because, like acceptance criteria, it is used to prove that a story is complete. </li>
<li>The difference with the DoD is that it is a list of requisites that determine that a story meets company or project requirements, instead of only technical requirements. </li>

</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Decomposed PBI</h1>
<ul>
<li>A Refined and Ready PBI may be pulled into the Sprint backlog.</li>
<li>However, the PBI must be  Decomposed into Tasks before it can be worked on.</li>
<li>Caution:
Don't <i><u><b>over</b></u></i> focus on defining tasks</li>

<p>A Refined and Ready PBI may be:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>placed into the Sprint Backlog</li>
<li>chosen by a member of the Development Team</li>

<p>PBI is decomposed into Tasks</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Assigning Points for PBI Sizing</h1>
<ul>
<li>Story points 	</li>
<ul>
<li>A very common way to estimate work based on size, effort and complexity, not duration</li>
<li>Unit less and numerically relative</li>
<li>Points are additive, based on historical reality and easy to use and understand</li>
<li>Common practices:  Fibonacci sequence  [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ]</li>
<li>Sometimes other cards are added:  ? (I still have questions) and <b>∞</b> (too big to estimate)</li>
</ul>
<li>Planning Poker</li>
<ul>
<li>Each PBI has a size.  </li>
<li>Each developer has a deck of estimation cards.</li>
<li>Product Owner reads a user story and it's discussed briefly</li>
<li>Each developer selects a card that's his or her estimate</li>
<li>Cards are turned over at the same time so all can see them</li>
<li>Differences are discussed (especially outliers)</li>
<li>Re-estimate until estimates converge</li>
<li>Eventually, as the team gets better at estimating, use older PBIs as a relative measure of new work.  &quot;Remember that previous bit of work?  This one is like it.  And the previous one was a 13.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Assigning Points for PBI Value</h1>
<ul>
<li>Business Value can also be assigned points as well</li>
<li>Y axis of burn down and burn up charts can be Sizing or Business Value</li>
<li>Burn up charts may be more accurate – they show scope change</li>

<ul>
<li>A measure of Product Backlog Items delivered per Sprint</li>
<li>Used by the Development Team to gauge how much work to pull in a Sprint Planning meeting</li>
<li>Used by Product Owner to provide forecasts on the Product Backlog completion</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Ordering the Product Backlog</h1>
<ul>
<li>Risk</li>
<ul>
<li>Identify risk for items in the Backlog</li>
<li>Do the highest risk items first</li>
</ul>
<li>Return on Investment (ROI)</li>

<li>Gives a single number by which to rank work</li>
<li>You can see value at a glance and this is less subjective</li>

<li>Because the Product Owner says so</li>
</ul>
<p>An accurate release plan requires an ordered and estimated backlog</p>
<p>An accurate release plan requires known Velocity</p>
<p>Rule #1</p>
<p>Rule #2</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Two Basic Types of Release Planning</h1>
<h2>Date Target Planning</h2>
<ul>
<li>The product will release on a specific date
</li>
<h2><u><b>We Must Answer</b></u></h2>
<li>How much of the backlog will be complete by a given date?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feature Target Planning</h2>
<ul>
<li>The product will release when specific features are ready</li>
<h2><u><b>We Must Answer</b></u></h2>
<li>When will features A, B, and C be ready?</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Sprint 0</h1>
<ul>
<li>Per Scrum, there is no Sprint 0</li>
<li>However, many organizations create a Sprint 0, for example:</li>
<ul>
<li>The planning team is responsible for producing 3 deliverables by the end of the planning iteration:</li>
<ul>
<li>A list of all prioritized features/stories with estimates</li>
<li>A release plan that assigns each feature/story to an iteration/sprint</li>
<li>A high-level application architecture, i.e. how the features will likely be implemented</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Ken Schawber, co-creator of Scrum agrees: &quot;Sprint 0 has become a phrase misused to describe the planning that occurs prior to the first sprint&quot;.</li>
